### Dependencies

The program is to be executed in Python3. The following dependencies are to be met:  

```
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
networkx
```

They may be installed automatically using `pip3 install -r req`.  

### Executing

Individual components of the program may be run using the following:  

```
python3 part_1.py
python3 part_2.py
```

The programs are interactive and ask the user for valid inputs.

The part 3 of the program has been divided into two parts. Clustering based on the given high level domains directly may be obtained using `python3 part3.py`. The NMI scores can be computed using `python3 NMI.py`.
