They may be installed automatically using `pip3 install -r req`.  

### Executing

Individual components of the program may be run using the following:  

```
python3 part_1_train.py
python3 part_2_train.py <num_hid_1> <num_hid_2>
```

The programs are interactive and ask the user for valid inputs. The data loaders are defined in part_1_data.py and part_2_data.py which are imported when required. The model methods are defined in frame.py.
